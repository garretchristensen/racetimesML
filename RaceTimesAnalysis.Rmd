# Summary

I'm just trying to learn some ML using my ultramarathon race times.

```{r, results='hide'}
data<-read.csv(file="racedata.csv", head=TRUE)
head(data)
```

To date, I have run `r nrow(data)` races, `r sum(data$Distance>=100)` of which were 100 or more miles long. This doesn't include a handful of off-trail or orienteering races. It does include (boring) paved marathons, of which I have run `r sum(data$Distance==26.2 & data$Trail==0)`.

The average distance of my races is `r round(mean(data$Distance, na.rm=TRUE))` miles. The average time elapsed is `r round(mean(data$Hours*60+data$Minutes, na.rm=TRUE)/60, digits=2)` hours.

# Plot
First, I'll plot time versus distance.

```{r}
data$Time=data$Hours+data$Minutes/60
plot(data$Time~data$Distance)
```
